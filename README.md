# RFM-Segmentation
Customer Segmentaion using RFM Analysis

This is a python code implementation of RFM Analysis of retail customers of a large retail store across multiple countries. We first segment the customers into 4 classes using Recency, Frequency and Monetary aspects of each customer and also implement a K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment the customers. 

The K-means algo did not provide the proper segments of customers and that need to be looked into for improvements.
